## Overview of Election Audit
Colorado Board of Elections employee, Tom, has come to request for our assistance as we have become well rounded Python users. He needs our skills report the finding for the election and to audit the tabulated results for U.S. congressional precinct in Colorado. Some of the things we will be auditing are the name of the candidates and their votes and percentage of the total votes as well as distinguishing the winner by popular vote. Some additional information that we will provide in our audit will indicate each precincts' activity and the leading county with the highest turnout.

## Election-Audit Summary


- Refactoring code is extremely beneficial for many reasons. Refactoring makes the code more efficient by taking fewer steps, using less memory, or improving the logic of the code to make it easier for future users to read. Overall, it allows a code to run better and smoother.
- On the other hand, there are some disadvantages to refactoring code and it is primarily to do with the fact that its so complex. The complexity can also result in more time consumption. Although very rewarding, if it is not needed it may not always be the best decision.
